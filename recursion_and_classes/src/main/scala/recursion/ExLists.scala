 * The goal of this exercise is to write function that retrieves the smallest
 * and largest elements from an IntList as a pair.

 * Because your functions must return 2 values, you will need to return a pair.
 * A pair containing the integers 1 and 2 is written as (1, 2).
 * Similarly, the type of a pair containing two integers is written as (Int, Int).
 * Here is a REPL session demonstrating how to create and use pairs:

scala> val pair = (1, 2)
val pair: (Int, Int) = (1,2)

scala> pair._1
val res9: Int = 1

scala> pair._2
val res10: Int = 2

scala> val (first, second) = pair
val first: Int = 1
val second: Int = 2

 * To find the smallest or largest of two integers, you can use the
 * scala.math.min and scala.math.max functions.
 *
 * If minMax is called on an empty list, it should throw an
 * IllegalArgumentException using throw IllegalArgumentException("Empty list!").
