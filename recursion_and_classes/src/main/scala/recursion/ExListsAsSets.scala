package recursion

/* Here you find a framework for the exercises on recursion.
The exercises are linked with different topics which you can check out in the readme file of the exercise.
You definetely don't need to implement all the functions to get a good understanding of recursion since many of them are quite similar. 
*/

//The next few exercises implement set operations on lists

//Write a contains(l, n) function that checks whether list l contains value n:

def contains(l: IntList, n: Int): Boolean ={
  ???  
}

//Write an isSubset(l, L) function that checks whether list l is a subset of list L (that is, all elements of l are also contained in L):
//You can use contains from above for this

def isSubset(l: IntList, L: IntList): Boolean ={
  ???  
}

/*Write an intersection(l, L) function that constructs a new list 
whose elements are the same as those of l in the same order,
but with all elements not contained in L removed:*/
//You can use contains from above for this

def intersection(l: IntList, L: IntList): IntList ={
  ???  
}

/*Write a difference(l, L) function that constructs a new list
whose elements are the same as those of l in the same order,
but with all elements contained in L removed:*/
//You can use contains from above for this

def difference(l: IntList, L: IntList): IntList ={
