package  recursion

/* Here you find a framework for the exercises on recursion.
The exercises are linked with different topics which you can check out in the readme file of the exercise.
You definetely don't need to implement all the functions to get a good understanding of recursion since many of them are quite similar.

//Recursion on Strings

//Implement a function that computes the length of a string:

def stringLength(s: String): Int ={
  ???
}

/*Implement a function that capitalizes every character in a string:
You will need the methods toUpper and toString of Char:

scala> 'c'.toUpper
val res30: Char = C

scala> 'c'.toString
val res31: String = c
*/

def capitalizeString(s: String): String ={
  ???
}

/*Implement a function that checks if a string is blank (i.e., if it only contains whitespace characters or is empty):
You may find the .isWhitespace method of Char useful:

scala> 'c'.isWhitespace
val res29: Boolean = false

scala> ' '.isWhitespace
val res30: Boolean = true
*/

def isBlank(s: String): Boolean ={
  ???
}

/*In this exercise, we call “word” any sequence of non-whitespace characters.
For example " Bonjour ! " has two words. Implement a function that counts the number of words in a string:
Example run:

scala> wordCount("  hello ")
val res32: Int = 1

scala> wordCount("  hello   world !")
val res33: Int = 3

As before, you may use c.isWhitespace to check if a character c counts as whitespace.
Consider defining a helper function discardWord that skips over the first word of a string
and returns the corresponding suffix 
(in other words, discardWord("abc def") should return " def").
*/

def wordCount(s: String): Int ={
  def discardWord(x:String): String={
    ???  
  }
    ???
}

/*Implement a function that encrypts a string using the Caesar cipher method.
The Caesar cipher is an ancient form of encryption,
where each letter in a string is shifted by a fixed number of places down the alphabet.

In this exercise, we assume that the input string only contains English lowercase letters.
In addition, we shift the letters in a circular way, so that z shifted by 1 becomes a, z shifted by 2 becomes b, etc.

Every English letter has a corresponding ASCII and Unicode code
which is an integer value. Codes of English letters are the same in ASCII and Unicode;
the English lowercase letter ‘a’ corresponds to the number 97, ‘b’ is 98, and so on up to ‘z’ which is 122.

In Scala, you can get the ASCII value of an English letter using the toInt method,
and convert it back to a character using the toChar method:

scala> 'a'.toInt
val res34: Int = 97

scala> 97.toChar
val res35: Char = a

Here is a REPL session demonstrating how to encrypt a single character:

scala> val aCode = 'a'.toInt
     | val zCode = 'z'.toInt
     | val numLetters = zCode - aCode + 1
val aCode: Int = 97
val zCode: Int = 122
val numLetters: Int = 26

scala> val dCode = 'd'.toInt
val dCode: Int = 100

scala> val dPlus3 = (dCode + 3 - aCode) % numLetters + aCode
val dPlus3: Int = 103

scala> dPlus3.toChar
val res36: Char = g

scala> val dPlus25 = (dCode + 25 - aCode) % numLetters + aCode
val dPlus25: Int = 99

scala> dPlus25.toChar.toString
val res37: String = c

And here are two additional examples of your caesarCipher function should behave:

scala> caesarCipher("abc", 2)
val res38: String = cde

scala> caesarCipher("abz", 3)
val res39: String = dec

Implement the caesarCipher function accordingly:
*/

def caesarCipher(s: String, shift: Int): String ={
  ???
}

//Implement a function that reverses a string:

def reverseString(s: String): String ={
  ???
}
