# Programming-2 Exercise 2: Structural Recursion and Class Hierarchies
In this exercise you will learn about structural recursion and classes in scala.
* As in the first exercise you need to obtain the exercise files. Clone or fork the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ur-tcs/programming-2-ex-2.git` or download it by clicking on the green `<code>` button and select `download`.

**Your are allowed to copy/clone/fork this repository, but not to share solutions of the exercise in any public repository or web page.**

## Structural Recursion
* We provide the signature of the functions you need to write in the exercise files. The body is replaced with ???: that’s the part you need to come up with!
* The exercise files are found in the folder `recursion_and_classes/src/main/scala/recursion`. The Exercises are those files which start with `Ex` (for exercise), sorted by the type of structure you will work on. The files `IntList.scala` and `IntTree.scala` should **stay unchanged**. They define the necessary classes you will work on in the exercises.
* You will perform recursion on different structures like lists, trees, etc. The sufficient background to solve the exercises is given below.
* The number of exercises is quite large, the exercises are provided for training purposes. Feel free to skip some of the simpler ones if you already have a good grasp on recursion and Scala programming!
* For each function we provided a test. As for the first exercise you can run the tests by entering `sbt` while you are in your project directory, and then compiling your code using `compile`. To run all the tests use `test`. If you only want to run the test of a specific function use `testOnly -- "*function*"`, where function is the name of the function you want to test.

For example you might find the following signature:
```scala
// As a first step implement the faculty function n!=n*(n-1)*...*2*1
def fac(n:Int) : Int = {
  ??? 
}
```
After you replaced the `???` by the correct code you might run `compile` and `testOnly -- "*fac*"`. In this case this will test if fac(6)==6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1. In particular a correct test does not necessarily mean that you implemented the correct function (you might also pass the test by replacing `???` by `720`).

Note that the syntax of scala does not require to specify the return type of the function, but for your convenience we already gave it.
Furthermore the curly braces are not necessary to mark the body of the function if you have the right spacing.

### Recursion on lists

In this exercise, you will write recursive functions that operate on lists. These lists are represented as instances of the IntList class. An IntList can be either:

* `IntNil()`, which represents an empty list,
* `IntCons( head ,tail )`, which represents a non-empty list starting with `head` (an integer) and continuing with `tail` (a list of integers).

Hence, the list `1, 2` is represented by `IntCons(1, IntCons(2, IntNil()))`.

IntList objects have three operations — `.head`, `.tail`, and `.isEmpty` — demonstrated in the following REPL session:
```scala
scala> import recursion.*

scala> IntCons(2, IntNil()).head
val res0: Int = 2

scala> IntCons(2, IntNil()).tail
val res1: recursion.IntList = IntNil()

scala> val oneTwo = IntCons(1, IntCons(2, IntNil()))
val oneTwo: recursion.IntCons = IntCons(1,IntCons(2,IntNil()))

scala> oneTwo.isEmpty
val res2: Boolean = false

scala> oneTwo.head
val res3: Int = 1

scala> oneTwo.tail
val res4: recursion.IntList = IntCons(2,IntNil())

scala> oneTwo.tail.isEmpty
val res5: Boolean = false

scala> oneTwo.tail.head
val res6: Int = 2

scala> oneTwo.tail.tail
val res7: recursion.IntList = IntNil()

scala> oneTwo.tail.tail.isEmpty
val res8: Boolean = true
```

**Polish Notation**
 
The last exercise on recursion on lists is a bit more advanced that the previous ones.

Polish Notation (PN) is a way to write arithmetic expressions where every operator comes before its operands. For example, instead of writing `3 + 4`, you would write `+ 3 4`.

Your task is to implement a PN evaluator for an `IntList` where operators are represented by negative integers: we’ll deal with just addition and multiplication for now:

```scala
val Add = -1
val Multiply = -2
```

For example, the expression `3 + 4` would be represented as `IntCons(Add, IntCons(1, IntCons(2, IntNil())))` and the expression `3 * 4` would be represented as `IntCons(Mul, IntCons(1, IntCons(2, IntNil())))`.

Here is a REPL session demonstrating how the polishEval function should behave:

```scala
scala> // List:   [Add, 3, 4]
scala> // Prefix: + 3 4
scala> // Infix:  3 + 4
scala> val expr1 = IntCons(Add, IntCons(3, IntCons(4, IntNil())))
val expr1: recursion.IntCons = IntCons(-1,IntCons(3,IntCons(4,IntNil())))

scala> polishEval(expr1)
val res40: (Int, recursion.IntList) = (7,IntNil())

scala> // List:   [Multiply, Add, 5, 3, 4]
scala> // Prefix: * + 5 3 4
scala> // Infix:  (5 + 3) * 4
scala> val expr2 = IntCons(Multiply, IntCons(Add, IntCons(5, IntCons(3, IntCons(4, IntNil())))))
val expr2: recursion.IntCons = IntCons(-2,IntCons(-1,IntCons(5,IntCons(3,IntCons(4,IntNil())))))

scala> polishEval(expr2)._1
val res41: Int = 32
```

### Lists as Sets
Lists are ordered collections of objects; as a result, most set operations can be defined on them too. There is no additional explanation needed to solve the corresponding exercises.

### Recursion on Trees
Now, we’ll explore recursion on binary trees. A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children. An `IntTree` can be either:

+ `IntEmptyTree()`, which represents an empty tree,
+ `IntBranch( value , left , right)`: which represents a node with value `value` (an integer) and two children `left` and `right` (trees of integers).

Hence, a tree with two non-empty nodes, a root node with value `1` with a left child with value `2`, is represented by `IntBranch(1, IntBranch(2, IntEmptyTree(), IntEmptyTree()), IntEmptyTree())`.

IntTree objects have four operations — `.value`, `.left`, `.right` and `.isEmpty` — demonstrated in the following REPL session:

```scala

scala> import recursion.*

scala> IntBranch(2, IntEmptyTree(), IntEmptyTree()).value
val res11: Int = 2

scala> IntBranch(2, IntEmptyTree(), IntEmptyTree()).left
val res12: recursion.IntTree = IntEmptyTree()

scala> IntBranch(2, IntEmptyTree(), IntEmptyTree()).right
val res13: recursion.IntTree = IntEmptyTree()

scala> val tree = IntBranch(1, IntBranch(2, IntEmptyTree(), IntEmptyTree()), IntEmptyTree())
val tree: recursion.IntBranch = IntBranch(1,IntBranch(2,IntEmptyTree(),IntEmptyTree()),IntEmptyTree())

scala> tree.isEmpty
val res14: Boolean = false

scala> tree.value
val res15: Int = 1

scala> tree.left
val res16: recursion.IntTree = IntBranch(2,IntEmptyTree(),IntEmptyTree())

scala> tree.left.isEmpty
val res17: Boolean = false

scala> tree.left.value
val res18: Int = 2

scala> tree.left.left
val res19: recursion.IntTree = IntEmptyTree()

scala> tree.left.right
val res20: recursion.IntTree = IntEmptyTree()

scala> tree.right
val res21: recursion.IntTree = IntEmptyTree()

scala> tree.right.isEmpty
val res22: Boolean = true
```

### Recursion on Strings

In this exercise, you will write recursive functions that operate on strings. A string can be thought of as a list of characters. Like lists, we can apply the same structural recursion principles to strings. Each string has the `isEmpty`, `head` and `tail` methods similar to `IntList`:

```scala
scala> "Hello Ada".tail
val res25: String = ello Ada

scala> "Hello Ada".tail.head
val res26: Char = e

scala> "Hello Ada".tail.isEmpty
val res27: Boolean = false

scala> " ".isEmpty
val res28: Boolean = false

scala> "".isEmpty
val res29: Boolean = true
```

Note the type of the `head` method: it returns a Char, not a String. A Char is a single character, whereas a String is a sequence of characters. A String is surrounded by double quotes (e.g. "This is a String"), whereas a Char is surrounded by single quotes (e.g. 'c').

For the respective exercises, you must not use any other method than `isEmpty`, `head` and `tail` on strings.

## Classes

In this exercises you will get familiar with (abstract) classes, traits, companion objects, etc.

### Geometric Objects

We want to construct a class hierarchy of some geometric objects, namely circles, squares and cubes. Before we guide you through the exercise, here is what we want to implement in the end. You may try to implement this without further reading.

+ We want to implement three classes: `Circle`, `Square` and `Cube`.
+ Each class should have a dimension, a diameter (diameter for circle or diagonal for square and cube) and should be able to compute their area or volume.
+ Clearly some of these objects share some properties. The goal is to model the shared aspects via traits and/or abstract classes
+ In order to compute the area of a circle, we don't want to use the "exact" value of pi, but instead create our own constant `approxPi`. This value should be equal for all objects of the class `Circle`, but we should be able to change the value uniformly by just modifying one line of code.
+ For every geometric object we would like to have a method `quadrature`, which returns a cubic object with the same volume as the original one (with respect to `approxPi`), e.g. if `circ1` is an object of the class `Circle`, then `circ1.quadrature` returns a square with the same surface as circ1.
+ As a bonus you can implement another class `Ball` analogously to circle. At least you should keep the right traits in mind such that such an extension is easily possible.

Here are some useful tools for this exercise:
```scala
Math.Pi                                     // The exact value of Pi
Math.pow(base, exponent)                    // The exponentiation function
Math.sqrt(x)                                // The square root
Math.round(x*Math.pow(10,n))/Math.pow(10,n) // This will round the value x to n decimals
length = diameter/(Math.sqrt(n))            // Connection between length and diameter in an n-dimensional cube
```

We encourage you to test your program yourself. A good playground is again a worksheet, where you imported the necessary files.

<details>
<summary> Hint: Which classes and traits should I define </summary>
The following is one of many solutions to this question:

+ an abstract class `Geometric` for all of our classes
+ traits `Planar` for `Circle` and `Square`, and `Spatial` for `Cube` (and a possible `Ball`) which all extend `Geometric`
+ classes `Square`, `Circle` and `Cube` which are all subclasses of `Geometric` and have the natural traits.
</details><br/>

<details>
<summary> Hint: Which classes/traits should contain which variables/methods </summary>
Since every geometric object in our case should have a diameter, dimension and volume, those are defined in the abstract class Geometric:

```scala
abstract class Geometric:
  def diameter: Double
  def dimension: Int
  def volume: Double // for two-dimensional objects, volume is interpreted as the area
```

The traits `Planar` and `Spatial` tell you in which dimension you are; so the value of `dimension` is fixed in these traits. Furthermore, the traits can already decide which type the `quadrature` method should have: `Square` for the two dimensional and `Cube` for the three dimensional case.

```scala
trait Planar extends Geometric:
  def dimension = 2
  def quadrature: Square

trait Spatial extends Geometric:
  def dimension = 3
  def quadrature: Cube
```

Because `Square` and `Cube` have an easy way to compute their volume, we may implement this in our `Rectangular` trait, which has access to a dimension as it extends `Geometric`. It might be useful to define an extra value `length`.

```scala
trait Rectangular extends Geometric:
  def length = diameter/(Math.sqrt(dimension))
  def volume: Double = Math.pow(length, dimension)
```

Note that we can now define classes that combine `Planar` or `Spatial` with `Rectangular`.

<details>
<summary> Hint: How to implement approxPi </summary>

Since `approxPi` should play the role of a static variable in Java, we put it into a companion object for our class `Circle`. That is, we create an object with the same name like the class and define a variable `approxPi` in it.

To be precise, your companion object could look something like this:
```scala
object Circle {
  val approxPi = ???
}
```
</details><br/>

### A string list

We want to construct a class `stringList` that represents a sentence as a list of strings. A string list should be filled with strings and automatically saved as a sentence, such that the following function returns the content as syntactically correct sentence in the sense that the first word starts with a capital letter, the words are separated by whitespaces and the sentence ends with a point.

```scala
def printList(s : StringList) : String =
  if s.isLast then 
    s.current
  else 
    s.current + printList(s.rest)
  end if
}
```
The above functions will return "Make this sentence syntax." for the input " `First("make",Next("this", Next("sentence", Next("syntax",Last()))))`. By the choice of this minimal working example you will necessarily need to define at least the following:
 + classes `First`, `Next`, `Last`
 + a method `isLast`
 + values `current` and `rest` for the class `StringList`

Note that you are not allowed to change the function `printList` in order to get the desired result.

If you did not have a look on the exercises on recursion, looking at them first may help.

<details>
<summary> How do I start?/What's the connection to the exercises on recursion? </summary>
The construction of our StringList is very similiar to IntList. The definition of the abstract class IntList can be found in the file "IntList.scala" of the exercise files on recursion. However only copying will just produce "makethissentencesyntax" as result. What can you change/add?
